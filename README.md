# AquariumPipeGameSolutions1
I taught an introductory OOP course to an A-Level class at Wimbledon High School. This repository provides solutions to the first 10 questions of the Aquarium Pipe Game assignment I created as part of this course. Details of the full course can be found on my [personal website](http://www.ameliakhavari.com/).
